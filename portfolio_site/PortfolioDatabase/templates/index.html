and shipping useful features.</p>
<h5 class="mb-4">About Me</h5>
<p class="mb-1">Before tech I served as a tracked vehicle mechanic in the U S Army, where I learned discipline, 
    the fine art of troubleshooting, and how to stay calm under pressure. I bring that mindset to code with a 
    focus on readable design, steady iteration, and thoughtful teamwork. I work primarily in C sharp using .NET Computer 
    and in Python using Django. I lift, run, and tinker with PCs for fun, and I received my Bachelors of Science in 
    Computer Science from Weber State University in December 2025.</p>
